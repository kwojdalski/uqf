# Issue Claim

Claim a GitHub issue as in-progress. This prevents multiple Claude Code sessions from working on the same issue simultaneously.

## Usage

```
/claim <issue_number>
```

## What It Does

1. **Check if already claimed**
   ```bash
   gh issue list --label in-progress --state open
   gh issue view <number> --json number,comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | contains("Claimed by:")) | .body'
   ```

2. **If already claimed by another session:**
   - Show who, when, and hostname
   - Ask user to confirm before taking over
   - If confirmed, add new claim comment and add `in-progress` label

3. **If not claimed:**
   - Add claim comment with session info
   - Add `in-progress` label

## Claim Comment Format

```markdown
Claimed by Claude Code session
Hostname: <hostname>
Started at: <ISO timestamp>
Session ID: <random 8-char hex>
```

## Example

```
> /claim 87
Checking if issue #87 is already claimed...
Issue is available

Claiming issue #87...
Commented on issue: "Claimed by Claude Code session..."
Added in-progress label

Issue #87 is now claimed by this session.
```

## Stale Claims

If an issue has `in-progress` label but the claim is older than 4 hours, treat it as stale and allow re-claiming without confirmation.

## Labels Used

- `in-progress` — Indicates someone is actively working on this issue

## Integration

Other skills should call this before starting work:

```bash
# In auto-issue-triage or issue-triage
if ! /claim <issue_number>; then
  echo "Issue is already claimed. Skipping."
  return
fi
```

## Important

- Always include hostname to differentiate sessions on the same machine
- Use random session ID to differentiate multiple sessions on the same machine
- Do not add `in-progress` label without adding a claim comment
- Check for existing claim comments, not just the label (label could be stale)
- Do not use emojis
